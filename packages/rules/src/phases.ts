// ─────────────────────────── Phase legality table ────────────────────
//
// Issue #6: every action has a fixed set of legal phases. The table
// below is the single source of truth — `applyAction` does one lookup
// before touching any handler.
//
// Phase legality keyed off `state.phase` (one of `TurnPhase`). The
// special marker `'opponent-turn'` is used for `PlayReaction`, which
// is legal in any phase BUT must be played by the non-active seat.
// `applyAction` consults this marker after the phase lookup to decide
// whose turn the action belongs to.
//
// Why a static table?
//   - One lookup, deterministic, no branching tree.
//   - Trivial to test exhaustively (every `ActionType` × every
//     `TurnPhase`).
//   - New actions force a TS error here when added to `ACTION_TYPES`
//     because the `Record<ActionType, ...>` type is exhaustive.
//
// Phase mapping (rulebook §"Turn Structure" + wedge-rulebook-synthesis):
//   - `start`        : no player actions; only `EndPhase` advances to
//                      Mobilization. The Start phase is a bookkeeping
//                      step (unexhaust resources/units). Players cannot
//                      move, build, attack, or deploy in `start`.
//   - `mobilization` : board actions (move/build/attack/etc.) +
//                      `PlayTactic` (Tactic cards are legal in both
//                      phases per rulebook).
//   - `deployment`   : card-spending actions (deploy units, play
//                      Technology / Upgrade / Action / Event) +
//                      `PlayTactic`. No board movement here.
//   - `end`          : end-of-turn cleanup; only `EndTurn` is legal.
//
// Reactions (`PlayReaction`) are legal whenever the OPPONENT is acting,
// regardless of phase. We mark them with the `opponent-turn` literal
// rather than listing every phase — semantics differ from the
// active-seat lookup.
